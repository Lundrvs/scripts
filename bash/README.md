* [duckl](./duckl)

Browses the web in text mode with the search engine "duckduckgo" as the main page.

* [telltime](./telltime.bash)

Prints the current time on real time (second by second). As if you were watching the clock.
Change `$count = 500` to a higher value if it doesn not respect the clock's
second's count.

* [wtime](./wtime.bash)

Prints the current time in 24h format.

Why did I do this? Because it is a lot disturbing to type "date +%H:%M" everytime I want to watch the time and I have the panel hidden
and the shell in full screen...

* [shedown](./shedown.bash)

Schedules the execution of a process or service which doesn't needs any argument or option on its startup.
